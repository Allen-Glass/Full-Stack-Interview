# Momentus Technology Technical Interview

## Assignment 1: .NET Core API Code Review
### Prompt: 
A developer on your team who has never worked with C# before has committed code that needs to be reviewed. The code they committed contains a .NET API that pushes and pulls Student data. The new developer has asked that you review StudentController.cs, StudentService.cs, and StudentRepository to see if there is anything that should be redone.
### Instructions: 
Without refactoring, please review StudentController.cs, StudentService.cs and StudentRepository.cs and be prepared to give a peer review on each. Focus on functionality, best practices, and the formatting of the code. Approach this assignment as a code reviewer. Prepare your review feedback in whichever way you'd like as we will be collectively reviewing your feedback during the technical interview.

### Sample questions you may be asked:
1.	If any, what are your critiques on formatting and code layout?
2.	If any, what are your critiques on how information is being queried?
3.	If any, what are some limitations of the current design?

### Questions will be varied based on the candidate’s experience with C#/.NET.

## Assignment 2: Understanding Typescript TODO Application
### Prompt: 
You are the newest member of an engineering team. You have been tasked with taking over a coworker’s TODO application that is written in typescript/html/css. Your employer wishes to enhance this TODO application in the future, and it is your responsibility to gain a basic understanding of how the app works.
### Instructions: 
Without refactoring, learn the basic layout of the code and be prepared to answer a series of questions.

### Questions for experienced typescript developers who have worked with direct DOM access without a modern library such as React, Angular, or Vue:
1.	What is the work required to add a “Press Enter Key” to create a new TODO? 
2.	What is the effort of adding a “Save” to Local Storage option for TODOs persist?
3.	What is the scope of work required to add Server-Side saving of TODOs?

### Questions for more seasoned C# developers with limited web development/typescript experience:
1.	Describe to us how the business logic is tied into the visual layer.
2.	What are some of the advantages of using a basic js/html/css implementation over using a modern front-end library?
3.	Does a simple implementation like this benefit from utilizing typescript?
   
### Additional questions may be asked that are relevant to the candidate’s experience.
